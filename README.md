=== Ecoologi Neo4j

A first project to explore Neo4j.

== Install
With `.rvmrc` will create the gemset `ecoologic_neo4j` in your default ruby 1.9.3
`bundle`

Please note neo4j 1.8 is required (more complete sql, such as possibility to use delete and not only return in queries). The snapshot downloadable from the site worked with no problems here.

== Uninstall
`rvm gemset delete ruby-1.9.3@ecoologic_neo4j`
